Best In Show and People's Choice at San Francisco Science Hack Day 2015.

This was a father (hardware) and son (software) project done over 2 days.  We
instrumented a pool table with a LIDAR and an overhead camera â€” determining the
precise location of the balls and the cue using computer vision and time of
flight data.  These coordinates were fed into a physics engine which would
predict the outcome of the shot, which were in turn drawn onto the table using a
high-powered laser.
