Classified which of 6 expressions (Joy, Sorrow, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Fear)
were being displayed in grayscale images of subjectsâ€™ faces.  

We trained one-vs-many linear SVMs on Gabor filters applied to the input images.
We used existing standard datasets (i.e., Cohn-Kanade and JAFFE) as well as a
self-collected 47-subject dataset: the Berkeley Students and Friends (BSAF).
