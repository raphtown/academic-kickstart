An early project in my programming career, I led a team of half a dozen high
school students in the writing of a 3D space flight simulator. Different
subgroups successfully built in multiplayer capabilities, a custom physics
engine, and 3D models.  Unfortunately, documentation was not our forte, and
the above image is one of the few records we have remaining.  

The simulator was later integrated into the [FutureHand]({{< ref
"project/futurehand" >}}) project.
